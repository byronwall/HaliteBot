Python based bot created for the Halite bot competition.

There were a large number of submissions that ranged from simple and poorly performing, to complicated, to simple and well perofrming.

The final approach was one that used an agent-based approach.  It worked well except for expanding poorly.

All of the bots after v20 or so used a two-pronged approach where one startegy was employed before any attacks were possible, and that strategy was switched once an attack was possible.

The different strategies will get written up in time.
